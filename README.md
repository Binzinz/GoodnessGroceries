# Goodness Groceries

This repository contains my Bachelor Semester Project 3 & 4 at the University of Luxembourg which is an eco-friendly mobile application for iOS.
The app was built using the SwiftUI framework.

## Pre-requisites
* Xcode Version 12.0.1 (or higher)
* iOS 14.0 (or higher)

## Installation
Clone the repository to your computer:
```
git clone https://github.com/Flavio8699/Goodness-Groceries.git
```
Install [Rubustrings](https://github.com/dcordero/Rubustrings), which _checks the format and consistency of the Localizable.strings files of iOS Apps_:
```
sudo gem install rubustrings
```

## Build and simulate
1. Open the project file ***GoodnessGroceries.xcodeproj***
2. Once Xcode is open, wait until all the third-party libraries are fully downloaded and ready to run
3. Connect your ***iPhone*** with a USB cable to your computer or select the desired ***simulator*** on the top left corner
4. Tap the *Run* button (or <kbd>Command</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>) and wait until all the tasks are finished
